    "The assignment must be submitted on the DATA 201 and 422 Learn page and should be **your own pair** (or group of three if we are odd) **work**. Avoid plagiarism: if you are not sure what may constitute code plagiarism, read this http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mtaylor/ponline/index.php?id=source-code-plagiarism. Remember, when in doubt **declare your sources**.  \n",

The pace of the course is very quick, and you don't want to be working on this too long, as you would have less time for other assignments. I suggest you to submit what you have ready by the time the assignment is due, even if it is not everything we required. For any particular problem, please contact [Thomas Li](thomas.li@canterbury.ac.nz) or [Giulio Dalla Riva](giulio.dallariva@canterbury.ac.nz) or TAs.\n",
